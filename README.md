A passionate FOSS developer involved in many projects, as well as a few commercial projects I work on to make a living.

Note that most of my work is on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/hamishmb), except for projects I contribute to that are on GitHub - these repos are almost all just mirrors from GitLab. I no longer update these GitHub mirrors, so you should follow the links to GitLab where relevant. Here are my GitHub stats.
