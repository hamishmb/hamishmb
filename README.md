A passionate FOSS developer involved in many projects, as well as a few commercial projects I work on to make a living.

Note that most of my work is on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/hamishmb), except for projects I contribute to that are on GitHub. I have removed my personal work from GitHub as I do not want Copilot to use my code. Here are my GitHub stats.
